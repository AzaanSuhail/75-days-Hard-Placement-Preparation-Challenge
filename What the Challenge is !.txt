- I am not doing this for showoff but for my self-improvement and growth. I will document my journey daily. It's going to be challenging but rewarding. 
- I have collected all the structured paths and resources from where to learn and how much to learn, I have planned each and everything from scratch. I made my own path.
- If you are from tier 5 college like me where the on Campus placement is negligible then you have to put extra effort and rest depends on luck.
